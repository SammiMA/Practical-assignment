## Part 2
```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE }
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

### 1. Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown (1 marks)
```{r}
Meals <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-11-20/thanksgiving_meals.csv')

head(Meals, 10)  
  
```

### 2. Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`
```{r}
Meals %>%
  mutate(family_income-fct_reorder(family_income, parse_number(family_income)))
```

### 3. Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function (2 mark).
```{r}
summary(Meals)
skim(Meals) 
```

### 4. What is the number of people who celebrate?
```{r}
Meals %>%
  count(celebrate, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(celebrate == "Yes")
  
```

### 5. What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
```{r}
Meals %>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep)
  
```

### 6. Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.
```{r}
Meals %>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill = main_prep)) +
  geom_col()+
  facet_wrap(main_prep ~. )+
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Type of Main Dish", y = "Number of item", title = "How to serve your dish", caption = "Image 1") +
  theme_linedraw()
```

### 7. How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?
```{r}
Meals %>%
  count(cranberry) %>%
  filter(cranberry == "Canned" | cranberry == "Homemade")
```
```{r}
Meals %>%
count(gravy)%>%
  filter(gravy == "Yes")
```
### 8. What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges
### 9. Present this information in the most evident way on the data viz.
```{r}
Meals %>%
count(celebrate, family_income) %>%
  filter(celebrate == "Yes" ) %>%
  group_by(family_income) %>%
  ggplot(aes(family_income, n, fill = celebrate)) +
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Income Range", y="Number of people", title = "The Distribution of people across income ranges celebrate the Thanksgiving", caption = "Image 2") +
  theme_test()
```


### 10. What are the most common pies, sides, and desserts?
### 11. Present this information on a data viz
```{r}
pie <- Meals %>% 
  select(starts_with("pie")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(value !="None") %>% 
  filter(value !="Other (please specify)")

side <- Meals %>% 
  select(starts_with("side")) %>% 
  gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(value !="None") %>% 
  filter(value !="Other (please specify)")

dessert <- Meals %>% 
  select(starts_with("dessert")) %>%   gather(type, value) %>% 
  count(type, value, sort = TRUE) %>%
  na.omit(value) %>% 
  filter(value !="None") %>% 
  filter(value !="Other (please specify)")

new_combined <- rbind(pie, side, dessert)
```




### 13. How do the servings differ by income?
### 14. Present this information on a data viz
```{r}
Meals %>% 
  filter(celebrate == "Yes") %>% 
  count(main_dish, family_income) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill= family_income)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(family_income~.,) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Main Dishes", y = "Number of People", title =  "Image 3")
```
